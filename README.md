# Leap-Year
This program comprises two functions for identifying and printing leap years within a specified 100-year range from a given starting year. The function checks if a year 'a' is a leap year by confirming its even divisibility by 400.The function iterates through a 100-year span starting from "Start-year"

This program consists of two functions designed to determine and print leap years within a specified 100-year range starting from a given year. The first function, is_leap_year(a), checks whether a given year 'a' is a leap year by verifying if it is divisible evenly by 400. The second function, leap_years_between(start_year), iterates over a 100-year range starting from the specified 'start_year', utilizing the is_leap_year function to identify and print leap years. The program is then called with a starting year , printing leap years within the subsequent century. This tool is useful for quickly identifying leap years within a specific time frame.
